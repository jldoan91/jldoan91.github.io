      <h1>Daubentonia madagascariensis also known as the Aye-aye</h1>
      <p>The Aye-aye is a lemur that is native to madagascar. It is the worlds largest nocturnal primate as well. Here is an image of one.

        The Aye-aye is characterized by the way it finds its food. It will tap on trees to find grubs then gnaw holes in the wood with it's teeth. After that it will put it's narrow middle finger into the hole to pull the grubs out. Because of this method it fills the niche of a woodpecker.

      <h2>Behaviour and how they live</h2>
      <p>

        The aye-aye is a nocturnal and arboreal animal meaning that it spends most of its life high in the trees. Although they are known to come down to the ground on occasion, aye-ayes sleep, eat, travel and mate in the trees and are most commonly found close to the canopy where there is plenty of cover from the dense foliage. During the day, aye-ayes sleep in spherical nests in the forks of tree branches that are constructed out of leaves, branches and vines before emerging after dark to begin their hunt for food. Aye-aye are solitary animals that mark their large home range with scent. The smaller territories of females often overlap those of at least a couple of males. Male aye-ayes tend to share their territories with other males and are even known to share the same nests (although not at the same time), and can seemingly tolerate each other until they hear the call of a female that is looking for a mate.

      <h2>Anatomy and how they change as they grow</h2>
      <p>
        Young aye-ayes typically are silver colored on their front and have a stripe down their back. However, as the aye-ayes begin to reach maturity, their bodies will be completely covered in thick fur and are typically not one solid color. On the head and back, the ends of the hair are typically tipped with white while the rest of the body will ordinarily be a yellow and/or brown color.

        In length, a full-grown aye-aye is typically about three feet long with a tail as long as its body. Among the aye-aye's signature traits are its fingers.The third finger, which is thinner than the others, is used for tapping, while the fourth finger, the longest, is used for pulling bugs out of trees. The middle finger is unique in that it possesses a ball-and-socket metacarpophalangeal joint.
