    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>CSIS 1430 gives a great base for people who want to work their way into the world of web development. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the beginning any web developer needs.</p>
    <p>Although we only touched on JavaScript a little bit in this class it gave me a great understanding of the basics to be able to build on as I learn more.</p>
    <p>Even though i had already learned about HTML and CSS prior to this class I learned quite a bit here.</p>
    <p>Going through this course has made me more comfortable with CSS specifically which I was hesitant to work with before.</p>
    <p>Overall this class did a great job at making sure I have a strong base in the foundations of web development.</p>
