      Blue beard the pirate is known to his friends as Jimmy. Any time Jimmy would arrive in a town everyone would <b><u>1st Verb</u></b> and scream “<b><u>1st Verb</u></b> or he’ll <b><u>2nd Verb</u></b> you in a <b><u>1st Noun</u></b>”. Everyone was afraid of him and his <b><u>1st Adjective</u></b> pet parrot, named Sophie. He didn’t want to be feared, he only ever <b><u>2nd Verb</u></b> one person in a <b><u>1st Noun</u></b> anyway. Jimmy took his <b><u>2nd Noun</u></b> down and put up a <b><u>2nd Adjective</u></b> one instead to help people not <b><u>1st Verb</u></b> when he first got to town. Eventually everyone learned that the <b><u>1st Noun</u></b> was a misunderstanding from when he shoved his little brother into one.
